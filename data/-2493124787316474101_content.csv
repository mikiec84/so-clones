"            -w, --word-regexp&#xD;&#xA;Select  only  those  lines  containing  matches  that form whole&#xD;&#xA;words.  The test is that the matching substring must  either  be&#xD;&#xA;at  the  beginning  of  the  line,  or  preceded  by  a non-word&#xD;&#xA;constituent character.  Similarly, it must be either at the  end&#xD;&#xA;of  the  line  or  followed by a non-word constituent character.&#xD;&#xA;Word-constituent  characters  are  letters,  digits,   and   the&#xD;&#xA;underscore."
