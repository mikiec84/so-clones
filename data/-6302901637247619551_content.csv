"    If /C or /K is specified, then the remainder of the command line after the&#xD;&#xA;    switch is processed as a command line, where the following logic is used to&#xD;&#xA;    process quote ("""") characters:&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    1. If all of the following conditions are met, then quote characters on &#xD;&#xA;    the command line are preserved:    &#xD;&#xA;     - no /S switch&#xD;&#xA;     - exactly two quote characters&#xD;&#xA;     - no special characters between the two quote characters, where special is&#xD;&#xA;       one of: &<>()@^|&#xD;&#xA;     - there are one or more whitespace characters between the two quote&#xD;&#xA;       characters&#xD;&#xA;     - the string between the two quote characters is the name of an executable&#xD;&#xA;       file.&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    2. Otherwise, old behavior is to see if the first character is a quote&#xD;&#xA;    character and if so, strip the leading character and remove the last quote&#xD;&#xA;    character on the command line, preserving any text after the last quote&#xD;&#xA;    character."
