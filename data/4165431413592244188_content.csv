"    Timed out while waiting for the machine to boot. &#xD;&#xA;    This means that Vagrant was unable to communicate with the guest machine&#xD;&#xA;    within the configured (""""config.vm.boot_timeout"""" value) time period.&#xD;&#xA;    If you look above, you should be able to see the error(s) that&#xD;&#xA;    Vagrant had when attempting to connect to the machine. These errors&#xD;&#xA;    are usually good hints as to what may be wrong.&#xD;&#xA;    If you're using a custom box, make sure that networking is properly&#xD;&#xA;    working and you're able to connect to the machine. It is a common&#xD;&#xA;    problem that networking isn't setup properly in these boxes.&#xD;&#xA;    Verify that authentication configurations are also setup properly,&#xD;&#xA;    as well.&#xD;&#xA;    If the box appears to be booting properly, you may want to increase&#xD;&#xA;    the timeout (""""config.vm.boot_timeout"""") value."
